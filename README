This is a mock implementation of the DRMAAv2 C language binding.
If you don't know what DRMAA is, please consult http://www.drmaa.org.

The intention is to provide a reference for true product implementations
of the C language binding. The source code licence is newBSD, which allows the unrestricted usage
in both closed source and open source projects.

We would be happy if you give us a hint if this code was helpful for you.
Additions to the test suite are also more than welcome.

====== WARNING ======
Currently, this is NOT the final C binding for DRMAAv2. 
If you are a DRM system vendor and intent to use the header file in this repository for some production code, 
stop here and talk to us first.
